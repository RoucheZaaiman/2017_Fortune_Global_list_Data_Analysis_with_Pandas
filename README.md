# 2017_Fortune_Global_list_Data_Analysis_with_Pandas
In these project based exercises selected fundamental to intermediate Pandas operations are applied to do calculations. The Global 500 list from 2017 dataframe is used to for Data Analysis.

Fundamental Pandas operations and calculations in these project based exercises are as follows:
•	Selecting and slicing rows and columns or selecting specific values in Pandas using column names.
•	Vectorized operations
•	Using Boolean arrays in Pandas to enable better data analysis e.g. determining in which country each of the companies in the motor industry are.
•	Determining the coefficient of variation of the data.

Intermediate operations and calculations in Pandas are as follows:
•	Combining Boolean comparisons for more complex data analysis e.g. finding companies that have a large revenue but have negative profits and determining which companies are in the Technology sector but outside of the USA.
•	Using integer location to find a specific value or name e.g. determining the name of the company that has the most employees.
•	Using aggregation (loops in Pandas) to perform advanced data analysis, e.g. finding the top employer from each country or the companies from each sector that produces the biggest return on assets (ROA).

These Pandas exercises ware done through DataQuest and they also provided the dataset f500.csv. Originally these exercises were done using pure Python, but I converted the code to run in this Jupyter Notebook. The original Python code is also available in the same file as this notebook.
